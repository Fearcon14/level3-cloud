# Building a Cloud-Native Platform: From IaaS to PaaS

**Author:** Kevin Sinn

## Overview

**Meta-Track: Infrastructure → Platform → Product**

This track is about owning the full stack. You will get your hands on building a complete cloud platform stack end-to-end—starting from raw infrastructure, moving through Kubernetes, and ending with a production-grade PaaS product featuring APIs, UI, automation, and observability.

Every phase results in something tangible. By the end, you will have built and operated a real platform that reflects how modern cloud providers actually work.

Outcome: A fully functional PaaS on Kubernetes, running on OpenStack and SKE, complete with automation, observability, and developer tooling.
