# Building a Cloud-Native Platform: From IaaS to PaaS

**Author:** Kevin Sinn

## Overview

**Meta-Track: Infrastructure → Platform → Product**

This track is about owning the full stack. You will get your hands on building a complete cloud platform stack end-to-end—starting from raw infrastructure, moving through Kubernetes, and ending with a production-grade PaaS product featuring APIs, UI, automation, and observability.

Every phase results in something tangible. By the end, you will have built and operated a real platform that reflects how modern cloud providers actually work.

Outcome: A fully functional PaaS on Kubernetes, running on OpenStack and SKE, complete with automation, observability, and developer tooling.

## Week 1

This week's Notion page contains all the knowledge, notes, and learnings obtained during Week 1 of the cloud-native platform journey.

### Goal

Understand and operate Infrastructure-as-a-Service by setting up and validating an OpenStack environment.

### Scope
1. **Understanding the OpenStack Architecture**
   - How OpenStack is structured
   - Responsibilities of core components:
     - Virtual Machines
     - Networks
     - Storage and related services
2. **Installation and Basic Configuration** of a Single-node OpenStack cluster using DevStack
3. **Validation of the installation** by:
   - Checking system logs
   - Checking service status and health
4. **Deployment** of a virtual machine via OpenStack
5. **Architecture Analysis:**
   - Analyze the current installation
   - Create a technically correct architecture diagram of the setup
